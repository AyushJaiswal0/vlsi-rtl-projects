# VLSI RTL Projects

This repository documents my RTL design implementations using Verilog HDL.  
Each project includes synthesizable RTL code, a dedicated testbench, and simulation results verified in ModelSim.

The focus of this repository is to strengthen my understanding of:

- Register Transfer Level (RTL) design
- Finite State Machine (FSM) modeling
- Sequential and combinational logic
- Testbench development
- Waveform-based debugging
