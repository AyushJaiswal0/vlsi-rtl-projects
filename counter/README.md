# 4-Bit Up/Down Counter (Verilog RTL)

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a 4-bit up/down counter using synthesizable Verilog RTL.

The counter supports:
- Asynchronous reset (active high)
- Enable control
- Direction control (up/down)
- Wrap-around behavior

The design was verified using ModelSim with a dedicated testbench.

## 🧠 Design Description

The counter is implemented using a sequential `always` block triggered on:

- Positive edge of clock
- Positive edge of asynchronous reset

On reset assertion:
q <= 4'b0000;


When enabled:
- If `dir = 1` → counter increments
- If `dir = 0` → counter decrements

Since the counter is 4-bit wide, it naturally wraps:
- `1111 + 1 → 0000`
- `0000 - 1 → 1111`

Non-blocking assignments (`<=`) are used to ensure proper sequential behavior.
